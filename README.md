# XiCoin
Personal project to learn more about blockchain technology, and the potential applications for software engineering and games.
Before delving into the code, I heavily advise you work on looking into cryptography if you haven't already, alongside the basics of blockchain technology.

## Note from Author
There are excellent tutorials online that help you take what I've written and create your own custom implementations super easily! I would prefer if you were
to make improvements, you should do it on the main branch on GitHub, to help improve the product for everyone.

Made an improvement or wallet you're particularly proud of? 
Drop me an email at work@jmerritt.uk!
